## Database

Your data is stored in `equipment.db` in the same folder as the app.

**To move to another computer:** 
1. Copy the entire folder
2. Run `python app.py` on the new computer

## Accessing from Other Devices

**On your local network:**
1. Find your computer's IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
2. On other devices, go to: `http://192.168.1.100:5000`
3. Now you can scan with phones/tablets on the same network

**Important:** Keep the terminal window open while the server is running!

## Troubleshooting

**Can't access from phone:**
- Make sure phone and computer are on same WiFi network
- Check your computer's firewall settings
- The server must be running (terminal window open)

**Database errors:**
- Delete `equipment.db` file to start fresh
- Restore from your backup JSON file

**Camera not working:**
- Make sure you're using HTTPS or localhost
- Check browser permissions for camera access

## Tips

- Always make regular backups (download JSON file)
- Print extra QR codes in case they get damaged
- Use clear naming: "Projector-01", "Speaker-Main", etc.
- The database can handle thousands of items with no slowdown
